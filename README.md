## Build
- Install and configure JDK, Android SDK, Android NDK, Go and Go Mobile.
- `git clone` this project and at least submodule `library/core`.
- Replace `release.keystore` (can be generated by Java `keytool`) with your own.
- Append these to your `local.properties`
```
KEYSTORE_PASS=your_keystore_pass
ALIAS_NAME=your_alias_name
ALIAS_PASS=your_alias_pass
```
- Build APK:
```
./run lib core
./gradlew assembleOssRelease
```
- APK files will be in `app/build/outputs/apk`.
- Build plugin:
```
./gradlew :plugin:[plugin_name]:assembleOssRelease
```
- Plugin files will be in `plugin/[plugin_name]/build/outputs/apk`.
- To build another flavor, replace `Oss` with a flavor name.
